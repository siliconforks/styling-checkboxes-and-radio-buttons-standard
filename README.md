The code in this repository, like the code in its
[companion repository](https://github.com/siliconforks/styling-checkboxes-and-radio-buttons-nonstandard),
is derived from the example on MDN:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Advanced_styling_for_HTML_forms

However, the code in this repository is actually based on an older version of
the MDN example:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Advanced_styling_for_HTML_forms$revision/1387891

This code uses only standard CSS and thus may be preferable in some situations.

This code is licensed under the MIT license.  (The original code from MDN is in
the [public domain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/About).)
